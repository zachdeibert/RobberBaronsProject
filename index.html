            Many of the entrepreneurs of the Industrial Revolution could be considered either robber barons or captains of industry.
            Robber barons are considered people who exploit other people in order for their business to run properly.
            On the contrary, captains of industry are people who effectively run their businesses and benefit the whole country through them.
            Some people were both robber barons and captains of industry in different ways, and others were only one or the other.
            This presentation will explore influential entrepreneurs of the Industrial Revolution and determine if they were robber barons or if they were captains of industry.
