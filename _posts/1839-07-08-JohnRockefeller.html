title: John Rockefeller
description: >
    John Rockefeller was born in Richford, New York in 1839.
    In his early years, he started a shipping business with his neighbor.
    This business was very successful during the Civil war.
    However, when railroads were getting more popular, he switched to the oil refining business.
    He then optimized his entire process in order to help the environment and make it more efficient.
    Rockefeller was a captain of his industry in many different ways.
baron:
- His solution to some of the industryâ€™s problems was essentially a monopoly
- He participated in a scheme to force all oil refineries to use one unified system
- He started buying all of the other refineries so he would have the only one left
captain:
- He was extremely honest, which impressed all of his employers
- He donated to his church and local charities with the low wages he was paid
- He developed ways of improving the energy efficiency of all of his processes
- He owned every stage of the production of barrels to the oil refining in order to make it the most efficient
- He paid the Clark brothers (the co-owners of the business) $72,500 to give him all of the business (they did not want to keep expanding)
- He helped the environment by not wasting any materials and not improperly disposing of wastes
type: captain
conclusion: >
    John Rockefeller was a captain of industry because he helped the nation and the environment.
    He did not do many things that would hurt other people, so he should be considered a captain of industry.
